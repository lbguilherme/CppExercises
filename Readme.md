# CppExercises

## Rules

- There is a file called `internal.hpp`. You shall not touch it.
- Inside the code you shall not define macros that affect the behaviour of the read-only section.
- You shall not remove any code that is already there.

## Running Makefile

- `make`: Compiles and runs ALL exercises in order. Please note that most will fail to compile.
- `make e004`: Compiles and runs exercise 004. Replace by any other number. This is the best method.
- `make clean`: Just clean all executables. Not really needed for anything.

## Naming

Files are named as: `exercisenumber-difficulty-name-comment.cpp`.

 - `exercisenumber`: A increasing number just as id.
 - `difficulty`: A set of five integers separated by commas. See next session.
 - `name`: An arbitrary name. Exercises with the same name **must be done in order**.
 - `comment`: Just a comment to differ from exercises with the same name.

## Difficulty table

----- | ---------- | ------ | ------------ | --------- | ----------------
0 | Trivial | Nothing | Anything will do | Just logic | Nothing
1 | Some connection between classes | Usage of common things | Just don't do bad things | Very easy algorithms | Has templates
2 | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO
